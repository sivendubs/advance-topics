https://help.mulesoft.com/s/question/0D72T000003s3jcSAA/shared-object-store-using-objectstorev2-in-mule-4
(1) Is there a way to ignore the 30 days TTL of OSV2?
(2) Is there a way to enable sharing of an object store and its contents across multiple workers without using ObjectStoreV2?
Solution:
the Object Store attributes like entityTTL, max entries etc are ignored by OSv1 and OSv2, as they have their own limits pre-set as part of the platform feature set.
An Object Store and its contents (keys, values) is accessible to all CloudHub workers of the one Mule application that defines and therefore owns that Object Store. This means that as long as CloudHub workers are of the same application, they can share an Object Store.

Issue 10

https://help.mulesoft.com/s/question/0D52T00004tts31SAA/how-to-implement-cache-mechanism-for-multiple-workers-without-using-object-store
Solution:
Object Store v2 has a base rate of 10tps, you can pay to go higher or you can pay for an external service (e.g. database to store this). Or you can use non-persistent OS which has no sharing between workers, but is unlimited by any TPS constraints
